# Gogo Lib

A library for building Java applications.

## History

A long time ago, around the year 2006, I started writing a bookkeeping application that is now called Gogo Account.
While working on that application, I discovered I wass adding quite some code that was not specific to
Gogo Account and could be reused in other applications as well. I decided to move that code to this
library.
